But overnight, something magical happened—a giant beanstalk grew up into the sky! The next morning, Jack climbed it and found himself in the land of a giant. He saw a castle, golden eggs, and a harp that could sing by itself. Jack carefully took some treasures back home. But when the giant chased him, Jack quickly slid down the beanstalk.

Where are you going?” he asked, wiggling his tail. “To my grandmother’s house,” Red Riding Hood replied, forgetting her mother’s warning. The wolf grinned mischievously and ran ahead. He knocked on grandmother’s door and, with a little trickery, hid her in a closet. Then he put on her nightcap and climbed into bed. When Red Riding Hood arrived, she tilted her head. “Grandmother, what big eyes you have!” “All the better to see you with!” the wolf replied, trying not to sneeze. “And what big ears you have!” “All the better to hear you with!” “And what big teeth you have!” “All the better… to gobble you up!” Just as the wolf jumped, a brave woodcutter who was chopping nearby heard the noise. He burst in, scared the wolf away, and rescued Red Riding Hood’s grandmother. Red Riding Hood hugged her grandmother tight. “I promise, I’ll always stay on the path and never talk to strangers!” And from that day on, she skipped through the forest safely—and a little wiser too.",
